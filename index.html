		<p title="Dear mom...">Dear Mom, </p>
		<p>Happy Birthday Mama! I want to start off by saying, I am always thankful for your care, love, and dedication.
		Words cannot describe how grateful I am to be your son, and to have a mother like you in my life.
		I know I don't show it nor I often write a letter like this to tell you,
		but you are the most important person in my life and will always be.
		I won't be the person who I am today without you.</p>
	
		<p>And, I'm sorry for all the misery and worry that I have given you in the past. I'm sorry for not being the son that I was suppose to be. 
		I'm sorry for not being there when you needed me the most, and lastly I'm sorry for not saying how much I love you time to time.</p>
	
		<p>But, I know that you know, deep in my heart, I have and will always love you beyond the day of my death. 
		I want nothing more than you being healthy and happy. I will always work my best to repay all your time and effort. 
		I love you so so much, and wish you my dearest happy birthday.</p>
		
		<p>, Sincerely Joe.</p>
